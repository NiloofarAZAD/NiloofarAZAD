- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Niloofar and I am a passionate Computer Engineering student with a keen interest in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. 
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. I am fascinated by the potential of these fields to enable autonomous robots to navigate, understand, and interpret their environments. Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged in hands-on projects and coursework that have helped me gain both theoretical and practical skills and a deeper understanding of these domains.
Collaboration with professionals who share similar interests or who are involved in groundbreaking projects is something I am passionate about.
